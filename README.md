# Ovarian Cancer Subtypes

Ovarian cancer is a diverse group of malignancies with various subtypes characterized by histological and molecular differences. Here's an overview of the major subtypes:

## 1. Serous Carcinoma (CC)

Serous carcinoma is the most common subtype of ovarian cancer. It is further divided into:

### a. High-Grade Serous Carcinoma (HGSC)
   - The most aggressive subtype.
   - High cellular atypia and rapid proliferation.

### b. Low-Grade Serous Carcinoma (LGSC)
   - Less common and generally associated with a better prognosis.
   - More differentiated and less aggressive appearance.


## 2. Endometrioid Carcinoma (EC)

Endometrioid carcinoma is histologically similar to endometrial carcinoma and often associated with endometriosis.

## 3. Mucinous Carcinoma (MC)

Mucinous carcinoma is characterized by the presence of mucin-producing cells.

## 4. Other Subtypes

In addition to the major subtypes, there are other less common subtypes of ovarian cancer that may not fit into the primary categories mentioned above.
